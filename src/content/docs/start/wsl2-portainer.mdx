If you're a beginner to linux and docker/microservices, this how-to is a great starting point. This approach creates a clean canvas to deploy our AI tools in a modular and easily maintainable manner. We'll get to the actual AI stuff soon.

---

If you already have a linux workstation (bare metal or hypervisor-based VM), you can skip this step. If you're a Windows user, we'll deploy linux via WSL2.

## Why WSL 2?

- Native-speed Linux kernel on Windows
- Shared file system with Windows (`\\wsl$`) - no clunky dual-boot
- Perfect runtime for Docker without Virtual Machine overhead

  </p>
</div>

## Step 1 — Install WSL 2 + Ubuntu

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run the single command:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

   This:

   - enables all pre-requiste _Windows Subsystem for Linux_ features
   - downloads latest Ubuntu LTS (as of now version 24.04)
   - sets Ubuntu LTS as the default WSL 2 version

2. Create your Linux username/password.

That's it. After you set your password you'll be in your WSL2 linux environment. Use your search bar and search for "Ubuntu" to open a new terminal session at any time.

---

## Step 2 — Install Docker inside WSL 2

We're going to deploy the latest version of docker and use portainer as our container orchestrator and front-end.

1. Set up Docker's apt repository.

```bash
# inside the Ubuntu shell
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
```

2. Install the latest Docker packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

---

## Step 3 — Deploy Portainer with Docker Compose

Portainer gives us a browser dashboard to **launch / monitor / troubleshoot** containers and stacks.

We'll be using the stacks feature to organize and manage our containers in later lessons. For now, let's just get portainer running.

1. Create 2 new folders - a docker folder for our docker-compose file, & a portainer folder to mount portainer data to our host:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/docker/portainer
   ```

2. Add a `docker-compose.yml`:

Inside the `docker` directory, create a new file with the command `nano docker-compose.yml`.
Add the following contents -

```yaml
services:
  portainer:
    image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
    container_name: portainer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:8000" # Edge agent (optional)
      - "9443:9443" # HTTPS UI/API
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ~/docker/portainer:/data
```

ctrl + x to exit the nano editor & Y to save our new file changes.

{/* Adding a comment for clarity */}
{/* Note about editing files */}

- going forward, I'll assume you know how to make and edit files in linux.

3. Launch it:

   ```bash
   sudo docker compose up -d
   sudo docker ps
   ```

You should see the `portainer/portainer-ce:latest` image listed with a `up` status.

4. Open **https://localhost:9443** (enter an admin password on first run).

After setting a password, you're greeted with the portainer dashboard. Click "containers" to see the status of your newly created container.

Great, now we've created the canvas for our AI productivity environment.

## What's next?

Part 2 will show you how to:

- spin up **LLM API** using docker containers (Ollama + OpenWebUI) inside WSL 2 visually through Portainer Stacks.
